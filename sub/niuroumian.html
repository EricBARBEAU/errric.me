<h2 id="make-the-beef-soup-4-hours">01 - Make the beef soup (4 hours)</h2>
<p>Peel all the garlic cloves from the head. Remove the skin from the ginger piece. Chop them in medium sized pieces.</p>
<p>In a large pot, put your beef in cold water and let it simmer on medium/high heat for 10 to 15 mins. Then remove the beef and reserve the water in a container for later. Dry your pot and get it ready for the rest.</p>
<p>Put your large pot on medium/high heat. Add a good spoon of goose fat or oil in it, throw your garlic and ginger in the pot. After 1 minute, add a tablespoon of chili bean paste and stir the garlic and ginger with it.</p>
<p>Cut your beef in large chunky slices (at least 1cm thick) and add them to the pot. ou can add a tablespoon of black vinegar at that point (I do that) and give it a good stir and let it cook for 5 mins.</p>
<p>Add the water you reserved to the pot. Complete with more water until everything is well covered and has at least 2cm of water above.  Add your 5 star anises, some peppercorns (I guess around 15?), a teaspoon of 5 spices powder, 4 good tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 good tablespoons of black vinegar, some salt (depends how salty you like things, i dont put a lot) and 1 rock sugar (or 2 tablespoons or brown sugar) and a tablespoon of chili oil. Cover it and let it simmer on medium heat for 1 hour.</p>
<p>After 1 hour, add your tomatoes (I usually use canned ones so there is also some tomato sauce going in) to the soup. Taste the broth and adjust the spices to your taste. Let it cook 3 more hours on low/medium heat. If level is reducing too much, add some more water.</p>
<h2 id="make-your-bowls-of-niu-rou-mian">02 - Make your bowls of Niu Rou Mian</h2>
<p>If you cooked the soup the day before, warm this guy up until hot.</p>
<p>Boil your noodles in a pot with a bit of salt and a table spoon of black vinegar. Reserve when al-dente.</p>
<p>In 1 bowl, place a serving of noodles (should not be more than half the height of bowl i guess), from your beef soup, get some nice cut of beef (like 4 or 5) and place them in the bowl on the noodles. Wash your Bok choy and rinse under water and place them in the bowl (can put quite a lot as it will shrink with the soup).</p>
<p>Then finally the final :) just fill up the bowl with the beef broth until noodles are well covered. Add some pieces of tomatoes here and there. Enjoy it mate.</p>
